# Pearl Bot

The Ruby Community Discord's Pearl Bot.

## Development

We use the [discordrb](https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb) library. Have a
read of their [wiki](https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb/wiki) and their
[docs](https://drb.shardlab.dev/main/Discordrb) to see how it works

You will need a token, and a client_id, which you can acquire from a senior staff
